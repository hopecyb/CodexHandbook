year: 2023
summary: 'Models are fundamentally text generators — they can describe actions but cannot execute them. Function calling introduces a “capability menu,” allowing the model to choose tools and fill in structured arguments when needed. This turns plain responses into real, executable actions, marking the shift from “just talking” to “actually doing.”'

# Function Calling

- Evolution note: This capability line was later generalized into the broader `Tool Use` narrative. See `2025-03-tool-use`.

## What It Is

Function Calling is a capability that makes model output strictly follow function signatures (JSON parameter schema) and trigger external tool/API execution.

Its core value is not the act of "calling a function" itself. The key is converting model intent into executable, verifiable, and traceable structured interface requests.

## What Step It Moved AI Application Engineering From and To

It moved AI application engineering from "the model gives natural-language suggestions" to "the model outputs executable instructions that enter system pipelines."

Before Function Calling, many systems had to parse model text again, which was brittle and hard to control. After it, developers could organize execution directly around signatures, parameter validation, and error handling, significantly improving reliability.

This step made Agent systems, workflow orchestration, and business automation truly engineerable.

## What Stage It Is In Now

I currently mark Function Calling as `mainstream`.

Structured tool invocation has become a baseline capability of production LLM systems, and most serious AI applications depend on it in some form.

Its capability boundary is also expanding from function argument calls toward broader tool interaction, which is the context for the later Tool Use narrative.

## What It Might Replace

It replaces brittle chains like "text instruction + regex parsing + manual fallback."

As this pattern matures, developers rely less on loose prompt constraints and more on typed interfaces with execution feedback loops.

## What Might Replace It

It is more likely to be absorbed by higher-level abstractions than fully eliminated.

Future frameworks for broader Tool Use, multi-tool orchestration protocols, and standardized execution environments will likely internalize Function Calling as a foundational layer.
