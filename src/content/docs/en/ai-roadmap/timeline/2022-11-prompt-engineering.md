summary: 'Large language models are inherently probabilistic — the same prompt can yield different answers. Prompt engineering helps reduce this variance by setting roles, formats, and constraints, making outputs more stable and controllable. It also serves as the foundation for later paradigms like agents, function calling, and skills.'

# Prompt Engineering

- Mainstream milestone: 2022-11-30 (ChatGPT public launch, prompting entered large-scale practical use)
- Official references:

- Note: This entry records when Prompt Engineering became a foundational method in AI application engineering. Specific templates and tactics should be expanded in the Guide.

## What It Is

Prompt Engineering is a systematic engineering approach for designing input instructions to improve controllability, consistency, and task completion rates.

It is not about writing a few polished prompts. It is about building reusable processes around role definition, context organization, output constraints, step decomposition, and feedback iteration.

## What Step It Moved AI Application Engineering From and To

It moved AI application engineering from "ask in natural language and hope for a good result" to "design structured inputs and reliably get target outputs."

Before Prompt Engineering matured, many teams used models through ad hoc experimentation, and result quality varied heavily by operator. After it emerged, teams started to accumulate templates, patterns, and evaluation criteria, making model interaction reproducible, optimizable, and collaborative.

This step is critical because later capabilities like Function Calling, Agent orchestration, and Skills packaging all depend on one base idea: first organize model behavior.

## What Stage It Is In Now

I currently mark Prompt Engineering as `mainstream`.

It has become a baseline capability in almost all LLM applications. Whether for individual use, product design, or enterprise deployment, prompt design is no longer optional.

As model capabilities improve, overly detailed prompts can become counterproductive. When every step is over-specified, the model has less room to use its own reasoning and planning strengths, which can reduce overall task quality.

At the same time, it is being absorbed by higher-level mechanisms such as structured outputs, tool calling, workflow orchestration, and reusable Skills. Those mechanisms do not replace Prompt Engineering; they elevate it from a point tactic to a system layer.

## What It Might Replace

It replaced early interaction styles where people treated models as random search/chat boxes and hoped for good results.

In teams, it also replaced a large amount of non-reusable tribal knowledge by turning "who asks better" into "how the team defines tasks and output standards."

## What Might Replace It

It is unlikely to be fully replaced. It is more likely to be wrapped by higher abstractions.

If task-graph standards, automatic prompt optimizers, or more constrained model interface layers mature, the explicit workload of prompt writing may shrink. Its core ideas will still be embedded inside those systems rather than disappearing.
