date: 2025-03-11
year: 2025
summary: 'This is not a brand-new concept, but a system-level generalization of function calling. Function calling answers “how to call,” while tool use expands “what can be called.” Tools now include search engines, code interpreters, browsers, and databases. It extends the model’s capability boundary from language to all callable external resources.'

# Tool Use

- Capability upgrade milestone: 2025-03-11

- Evolution note: This entry records the capability generalization from `Function Calling -> Tool Use`, not a separate underlying mechanism disconnected from Function Calling.

## What It Is

Tool Use is a broader interaction paradigm where models do more than emit one set of function arguments. They can choose, call, combine, and coordinate multiple external tools during task execution.

In this paradigm, function calling is one specific tool interaction form. Engineering focus expands to ecosystem access, invocation strategy, execution feedback, and multi-step collaboration.

## What Step It Moved AI Application Engineering From and To

It moved AI application engineering from "structured calls to a single function/API" to "task-oriented orchestration across multiple tools."

That expands engineering focus from parameter correctness to tool selection, call order, context transfer, failure recovery, and result synthesis. System complexity rises, but so does capability ceiling.

## Why It Deserves Its Own Entry

Tool Use and Function Calling are on the same capability line, but Tool Use represents boundary expansion and an engineering focus shift.

Function Calling emphasizes "make one call correctly." Tool Use emphasizes "use a full tool system effectively." Splitting them into separate timeline entries makes this upgrade inflection visible.

## What Stage It Is In Now

I currently mark Tool Use as `emerging`.

Major platforms are clearly pushing it as a core capability direction, but cross-platform protocols, observability standards, and cost-control practices are still evolving quickly.

The trend is clear, but best practices are not fully settled.

## What It Might Replace

It can replace part of semi-automated flows built as "single function call + manual step stitching."

As Tool Use matures, systems will rely more on model-driven dynamic multi-tool collaboration and less on hardcoded orchestration in business logic.

## What Might Replace It

It is more likely to be absorbed into higher-level execution standards than disappear.

Unified task-graph protocols, standardized agent communication layers, and system-level execution governance platforms may further abstract today's Tool Use patterns.
